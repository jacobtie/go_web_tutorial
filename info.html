                    Go is an open source language created by engineers from Google. 
                    The language was created by Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike. 
                    Go is a compiled, statically typed, and supports garbage collection and concurrency. 
                    What makes Go different, is that it was built to be intuitive to develop in, run for the web, and be efficient.

                <p>
                    Go is partially object-oriented. It does not have classes and objects in the traditional sense, but instead utilizes a user
                    defined type system, in which developers define complex data types. Functions can be created and bound implicitly to these types 
                    so that they function similar to how objects work in other object-oriented languages. Developers define types using the <code>type</code>
                    keyword. A working example of a Go Binary Search Tree as an object can be found 
                    <a href="https://github.com/jacobtie/go_binary_search_tree" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>. Users may also implement and define interfaces
                    which function similarly to interfaces in other languages. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go implements parallelism through goroutines. A goroutine fulfills two of the main goals of the Go programming language, those 
                    being ease in development and efficiency. Goroutines are incredibly easy to implement; the developer must only write the word 
                    <code>go</code> in front of a function call or an anonymous function.

                Go was first thought into existence in 2007 by three Google employees, Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
                These three Googlers started designing Go that same year. The primary motivation these three Googlers had for creating Go was
                their complete dislike of C++. Seemingly fueled by their mutual hatred of C++, the Googlers made Go open-source in 2009, and version 1.0
                was released in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                Go was primarily created in order to merge the best parts of multiple programming languages into one, while leaving out
                the bad parts. Some languages are compiled and fast, like C, but they are unsafe, hard to work with, and can suffer from many runtime errors.
                Other languages are interpreted, like Ruby. These languages are typically safer but are also slower and have many dependencies.
                Then you have other languages like Java that require a virtual machine, JVM, in order to run the code, which can make porting the
                code between different machines unreliable at times.

                Go in a general purpose programming language, meaning that it can be used for pretty much anything. However, there are a few things that
                Go is great for and some things that Go is not very good for.
                <br>Go is great for:
                <ul>
                  <li>Command-line apps/scripts.</li>
                  <li>Machine learning.</li>
                  <li>Automation.</li>
                  <li>Networking.</li>
                  <li>Web servers.</li>
                </ul>
                Go is not so good for:
                <ul>
                  <li>Desktop/GUI based apps.</li>
                  <li>System level programming.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            <p>
              The creators of Go have worked very hard in order to remove these drawbacks.
              <br>Go is:
              <ul>
                <li>Fast - Go has very fast compilation that you will barely notice.</li>
                <li>Safe - Go strongly typed, statically typed, and has a garbage collector.</li>
                <li>Easy - Go prides itself on being concise and explicit.</li>
                <li>Modern - Has built-in support for many different kinds of applications.</li>
              </ul>
              The creators of Go even have idioms for their language:
              <ul>
                <li>Get the job done.</li>
                <li>One way of doing things.</li>
                <li>Be explicit.</li>
                <li>Build things by composing them.</li>
              </ul>
              For all of these reasons, and more, Go has been increasing in popularity over the years, and it does not show any signs of slowing down.
