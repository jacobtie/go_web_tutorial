		<h3>Who Made Go?</h2>
		<p>
			Go was first thought into existence in 2007 by three Google employees, Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
			These three Googlers started designing Go that same year. The primary motivation these three Googlers had for creating Go was
			their complete dislike of C++. Seemingly fueled by their mutual hatred of C++, the Googlers made Go open-source in 2009, and version 1.0
			was released in 2012.

		<h3>Why Was Go Created?</h3>
		<p>
			Go was primarily created in order to merge the best parts of multiple programming languages into one, while leaving out
			the bad parts. Some languages are compiled and fast, like C, but they are unsafe, hard to work with, and can suffer from many runtime errors.
			Other languages are interpreted, like Ruby. These languages are typically safer but are also slower and have many dependencies.
			Then you have other languages like Java that require a virtual machine, JVM, in order to run the code, which can make porting the
			code between different machines unreliable at times.
		</p>
		<p>
			The creators of Go have worked very hard in order to remove these drawbacks.
			<br>Go is:
			<ul>
				<li>Fast - Go has very fast compilation that you will barely notice.</li>
				<li>Safe - Go strongly typed, statically typed, and has a garbage collector.</li>
				<li>Easy - Go prides itself on being concise and explicit.</li>
				<li>Modern - Has built-in support for many different kinds of applications.</li>
			</ul>
			The creators of Go even have idioms for their language:
			<ul>
				<li>Get the job done.</li>
				<li>One way of doing things.</li>
				<li>Be explicit.</li>
				<li>Build things by composing them.</li>
			</ul>
			For all of these reasons, and more, Go has been increasing in popularity over the years, and it does not show any signs of slowing down.

			<h3>What Is Go Used For?</h3>
			<p>
				Go in a general purpose programming language, meaning that it can be used for pretty much anything. However, there are a few things that
				Go is great for and some things that Go is not very good for.
				<br>Go is great for:
				<ul>
					<li>Command-line apps/scripts.</li>
					<li>Machine learning.</li>
					<li>Automation.</li>
					<li>Networking.</li>
					<li>Web servers.</li>
				</ul>
				Go is not so good for:
				<ul>
					<li>Desktop/GUI based apps.</li>
					<li>System level programming.</li>
				</ul>
