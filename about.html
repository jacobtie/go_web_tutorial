        This is a Website of Go, by Go, for Go.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name of the website, GoCeption, is a direct relation to what the purpose of this website is for.
        Our team built GoCeption so that you can learn Go through Go.
        Our interpreter will let you run basic Go code and see output so that you can practice your Go skills!
        You can also take a look at the <a href="/library">Code Library</a> to see sample programs and modify them yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        We bet you were wondering what makes this website written in Go.
        All that you can see here is HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
        Well it turns out that the back end of this website is written in pure Go.
        This means that no frameworks and no packages were used in this implemenation. That is the power of Go.
        This back end lives on Heroku's servers and renders our Go templates to create our finished HTML, CSS, and JS that we deliver to your browser!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two main parts of our Go backend. The first part concerns handling all the requests from your browers.
        Our <code>main.go</code> file uses the <code>net/http</code> package native to Go to handle different routes and send them to their handlers.
        Before being sent to the handlers, the request is run through middleware and checked to see that the path actually exists.
        When the path is verified, the request information is sent to the proper handler, the data is processed, and the data is sent to the template.
        Should the path does not exist, a 404 page will be displayed. <a href="/badpath">Check out an example here!</a>
        The template takes in the data and uses it to render the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After being rendered, the server sends a response
        to your browser with the rendered page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second main functionality of our backend is to handle your sample program from your interpreter.
        When you click "Run" your source code will be sent to our Go backend via a POST request.
        Your code is then sent to an API endpoint provided by Google located at
        <a href="https://golang.org/compile" target="_blank">https://golang.org/compile</a> with another POST request.
        This endpoint is run by Google. They compile it and send back either output or an error message.
        That information is then processed by our handler, sent to the template, and rendered.
