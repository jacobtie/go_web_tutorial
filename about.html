<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a sample about page. There is a main and about page. If you go to a route which does not exist, such as by 
    <a href="/sample1">by clicking here</a>, you will be met with a 404 page. This 404 page accepts the name of the route
    as a variable, which you can see change on the page depending on the route you go to. For example,
    <a href="/sample2">by clicking here</a> you will see the same 404 page but with different text based on the route name.</p>
    <p>This functionality will also work if you go to a subroute which does not exist, such as by <a href="/about/sample">clicking here</a>.</p>
